Q1. What is the difference between an Inner Class and a Sub-Class?
Ans: An Inner class is a class which is nested within another class. An Inner class has access rights 
for the class which is nesting it and it can access all variables and methods defined in the outer 
class.
A sub-class is a class which inherits from another class called super class. Sub-class can access all 
public and protected methods and fields of its super class.

Q2. What are the various access specifiers for Java classes?
Ans: In Java, access specifiers are the keywords used before a class name which defines the access
scope. The types of access specifiers for classes are:
1). Public : Class,Method,Field is accessible from anywhere.
2). Protected:Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong or from the
sub-classes,and from the class of same package,but not from outside.
3). Default: Method,Field,class can be accessed only from the same package and not from outside
of itâ€™s native package.
4). Private: Method,Field can be accessed from the same class to which they belong.

Q3. What's the purpose of Static methods and static variables?
Ans: When there is a requirement to share a method or a variable between multiple objects of a
class instead of creating separate copies for each object, we use static keyword to make a method
or variable shared for all objects.
