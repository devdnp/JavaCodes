Q89. I have multiple constructors defined in a class. Is it possible to call a constructor from
another constructor's body?
Ans: If a class has multiple constructors, it's possible to call one constructor from the body of
another one using this().

Q90. Whatâ€™s meant by anonymous class?
Ans: An anonymous class is a class defined without any name in a single line of code using new
keyword.
For example, in below code we have defined an anonymous class in one line of code:
public java.util.Enumeration testMethod()
{
return new java.util.Enumeration()
{
@Override
public boolean hasMoreElements()
{
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
return false;
}
@Override
public Object nextElement()
{
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
return null;
}
}
