Q89. I have multiple constructors defined in a class. Is it possible to call a constructor from
another constructor's body?
Ans: If a class has multiple constructors, it's possible to call one constructor from the body of
another one using this().

Q90. Whatâ€™s meant by anonymous class?
Ans: An anonymous class is a class defined without any name in a single line of code using new
keyword.
For example, in below code we have defined an anonymous class in one line of code:

public java.util.Enumeration testMethod(){

    return new java.util.Enumeration(){
        @Override
        public boolean hasMoreElements(){
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            return false;
        }
        @Override
        public Object nextElement(){
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            return null;
        }
    }
}

Q91. Is there a way to increase the size of an array after its declaration?
Ans: Arrays are static and once we have specified its size, we can't change it. If we want to use
such collections where we may require a change of size ( no of items), we should prefer vector
over array.

Q92. If an application has multiple classes in it, is it okay to have a main method in more than
one class?
Ans: If there is main method in more than one classes in a java application, it won't cause any
issue as entry point for any application will be a specific class and code will start from the main
method of that particular class only.

Q93. I want to persist data of objects for later use. What's the best approach to do so?
Ans: The best way to persist data for future use is to use the concept of serialization.
