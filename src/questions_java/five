Q19. What are the performance implications of Interfaces over abstract classes?
Ans: Interfaces are slower in performance as compared to abstract classes as extra indirections
are required for interfaces. Another key factor for developers to take into consideration is that any
class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement many interfaces.
Use of interfaces also puts an extra burden on the developers as any time an interface is
implemented in a class; developer is forced to implement each and every method of interface.
