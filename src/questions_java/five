Q19. What are the performance implications of Interfaces over abstract classes?
Ans: Interfaces are slower in performance as compared to abstract classes as extra indirections
are required for interfaces. Another key factor for developers to take into consideration is that any
class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement many interfaces.
Use of interfaces also puts an extra burden on the developers as any time an interface is
implemented in a class; developer is forced to implement each and every method of interface.

Q20. Does Importing a package imports its sub-packages as well in Java?
Ans: In java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren't imported and developer needs to
import them separately if required.
For example, if a developer imports a package university.*, all classes in the package named
university are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its
sub-package ( say department), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:
Import university.department.*
