Q76. Can we have static methods in an Interface?
Ans: Static methods can't be overridden in any class while any methods in an interface are by
default abstract and are supposed to be implemented in the classes being implementing the
interface. So it makes no sense to have static methods in an interface in Java.

Q77. In a class implementing an interface, can we change the value of any variable defined in
the interface?
Ans: No, we can't change the value of any variable of an interface in the implementing class as all
variables defined in the interface are by default public, static and Final and final variables are like
constants which can't be changed later.

Q78. Is it correct to say that due to garbage collection feature in Java, a java program never goes
out of memory?
Ans: Even though automatic garbage collection is provided by Java, it doesn't ensure that a Java
program will not go out of memory as there is a possibility that creation of Java objects is being
done at a faster pace compared to garbage collection resulting in filling of all the available memory
resources.
So, garbage collection helps in reducing the chances of a program going out of memory but it
doesn't ensure that.

Q79. Can we have any other return type than void for main method?
Ans: No, Java class main method can have only void return type for the program to get successfully
executed.
Nonetheless , if you absolutely must return a value to at the completion of main method , you can
use System.exit(int status).
