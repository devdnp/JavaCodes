Q76. Can we have static methods in an Interface?
Ans: Static methods can't be overridden in any class while any methods in an interface are by
default abstract and are supposed to be implemented in the classes being implementing the
interface. So it makes no sense to have static methods in an interface in Java.

Q77. In a class implementing an interface, can we change the value of any variable defined in
the interface?
Ans: No, we can't change the value of any variable of an interface in the implementing class as all
variables defined in the interface are by default public, static and Final and final variables are like
constants which can't be changed later.
