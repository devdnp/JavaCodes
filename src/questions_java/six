Q28. Can a class have multiple constructors?
Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets
used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.

Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?
Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual
objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override
static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the
code.

Q30. In the below example, what will be the output?
public class superclass {
    public void displayResult() {
        system.out.println("Printing from superclass");
    }
}
public class subclass extends superclass {
    public void displayResult() {
        system.out.println("Displaying from subClass");
        super.displayResult();
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        subclass obj=new subclass();
        obj.displayResult();
    }
}
Ans: Output will be:
Displaying from subclass
Displaying from superclass

Q31. Is String a data type in java?
Ans: String is not a primitive data type in java. When a string is created in java, it's actually an
object of Java.Lang.String class that gets created. After creation of this string object, all built-in
methods of String class can be used on the string object.

Q32. In the below example, how many String Objects are created?
String s1="I am Java Expert";
String s2="I am C Expert";
String s3="I am Java Expert";
Ans: In the above example, two objects of Java.Lang.String class are created. s1 and s3 are
references to same object.
