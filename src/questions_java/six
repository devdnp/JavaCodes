Q28. Can a class have multiple constructors?
Ans: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. Which constructor gets
used for object creation depends on the arguments passed while creating the objects.

Q29. Can we override static methods of a class?
Ans: We cannot override static methods. Static methods belong to a class and not to individual
objects and are resolved at the time of compilation (not at runtime).Even if we try to override
static method,we will not get an complitaion error,nor the impact of overriding when running the
code.
