1.  What do you understand by Java virtual machine?
Ans :   Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program.
        JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code.
        JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system.
        The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and
        close to the native code.

2.  What do you understand by JRE ?
Ans :   JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
        It is the implementation of JVM.
        The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing
        Java applications.
        It is used to provide the runtime environment.
        It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists.
        It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

3.      What do you understand by JDK ?
Ans :   JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit.
        It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and
        applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.
        JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by
        Oracle Corporation:

        a. Standard Edition Java Platform
        b. Enterprise Edition Java Platform
        c. Micro Edition Java Platform

4.      How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?
Ans :   Five types
        a) Class(Method) Area
        -  Class Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool,
           field, method data, and the code for methods.
        b) Heap
        -  It is the runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects
        c) Stack
        -  Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results,
           and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack,
           created at the same time as the thread. A new frame is created each time a method is
           invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.
        d) Program Counter Register
        -  PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine
           instruction currently being executed.
        e) Native Method Stack
        -  It contains all the native methods used in the application.

5.      What is  JIT compiler ?
Ans :   Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of
        the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount
        of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the
        instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.

6.      What is the Platform ?
Ans :   A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a piece of software is executed.
        There are two types of platforms, software-based and hardware-based.
        Java provides the software-based platform.

7.      What is main difference between Java platform and other platforms ?
Ans :   There are the following differences between the Java platform and other platforms.
        a) Java is the software-based platform whereas other platforms may be the hardware platforms
            or software-based platforms.
        b) Java is executed on the top of other hardware platforms whereas other platforms can only
            have the hardware components.
