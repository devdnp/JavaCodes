Q7: What is an infinite Loop? How infinite loop is declared?
Ans: An infinite loop runs without any condition and runs infinitely. An infinite loop can be broken 
by defining any breaking logic in the body of the statement blocks.
Infinite loop is declared as follows:
for (;;)
{
// Statements to execute
// Add any loop breaking logic
}

Q8. What is the difference between continue and break statement?
Ans: break and continue are two important keywords used in Loops. When a break keyword is
used in a loop, loop is broken instantly while when continue keyword is used, current iteration is
broken and loop continues with next iteration.
In below example, Loop is broken when counter reaches 4.
for (counter=0;counter<10;counter++)
    system.out.println(counter);
    if (counter==4) {
        break;}
    }
In the below example when counter reaches 4, loop jumps to next iteration and any statements
after the continue keyword are skipped for current iteration.
for (counter=0;counter<10;counter++)
    system.out.println(counter);
if (counter==4) {
    continue;
}
system.out.println("This will not get printed when counter is 4");
}
