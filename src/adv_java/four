Q9. What is the difference between double and float variables in Java?
Ans: In java, float takes 4 bytes in memory while Double takes 8 bytes in memory. Float is single
precision floating point decimal number while Double is double precision decimal number.

Q10. What is Final Keyword in Java? Give an example.
Ans: In java, a constant is declared using the keyword Final. Value can be assigned only once and
after assignment, value of a constant can’t be changed.
In below example, a constant with the name const_val is declared and assigned avalue:
Private Final int const_val=100
When a method is declared as final,it can NOT be overridden by the subclasses.This method are
faster than any other method,because they are resolved at complied time.
When a class is declares as final,it cannot be subclassed. Example String,Integer and other wrapper
classes.

Q11. What is ternary operator? Give an example.
Ans: Ternary operator , also called conditional operator is used to decide which value to assign to a
variable based on a Boolean value evaluation. It's denoted as ?
In the below example, if rank is 1, status is assigned a value of "Done" else "Pending".

public class conditionTest {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String status;
        int rank = 3;
        status = (rank == 1) ? "Done" : "Pending";
        System.out.println(status);
    }
}

Q12: How can you generate random numbers in Java?
Ans:
• Using Math.random() you can generate random numbers in the range greater than or equal
to 0.1 and less than 1.0
• Using Random class in package java.util

Q13. What is default switch case? Give example.
Ans: In a switch statement, default case is executed when no other switch condition matches.
Default case is an optional case .
It can be declared only once all other switch cases have been coded.
In the below example, when score is not 1 or 2, default case is used.

public class switchExample {
    int score=4;
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        switch (score) {
            case 1:
                system.out.println("Score is 1");
                break;
            case 2:
                system.out.println("Score is 2");
                break;
            default:
                system.out.println("Default Case");
        }
    }
}

Q14. What's the base class in Java from which all classes are derived?
Ans: java.lang.object
