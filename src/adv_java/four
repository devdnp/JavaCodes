Q10. What is Final Keyword in Java? Give an example.
Ans: In java, a constant is declared using the keyword Final. Value can be assigned only once and
after assignment, value of a constant canâ€™t be changed.
In below example, a constant with the name const_val is declared and assigned avalue:
Private Final int const_val=100

faster than any other method,because they are resolved at complied time.
When a class is declares as final,it cannot be subclassed. Example String,Integer and other wrapper
classes.

public class conditionTest {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String status;
        int rank = 3;
        status = (rank == 1) ? "Done" : "Pending";
        System.out.println(status);
    }
}
