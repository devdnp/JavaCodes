Q1. What is the difference between an Inner Class and a Sub-Class?
Ans: An Inner class is a class which is nested within another class. An Inner class has access rights 
for the class which is nesting it and it can access all variables and methods defined in the outer 
class.
A sub-class is a class which inherits from another class called super class. Sub-class can access all 
public and protected methods and fields of its super class.
