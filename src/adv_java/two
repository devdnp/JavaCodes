Q4. What is data encapsulation and what's its significance?
Ans: Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and 
methods in a single unit.
Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as 
each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other 
objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose.
