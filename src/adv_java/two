Q4. What is data encapsulation and what's its significance?
Ans: Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and 
methods in a single unit.
Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as 
each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other 
objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose.

Q5. What is a singleton class? Give a practical example of its usage.
A singleton class in java can have only one instance and hence all its methods and variables belong
to just one instance. Singleton class concept is useful for the situations when there is a need to
limit the number of objects for a class.
The best example of singleton usage scenario is when there is a limit of having only one
connection to a database due to some driver limitations or because of any licensing issues.

Q6. What are Loops in Java? What are three types of loops?
Ans: Looping is used in programming to execute a statement or a block of statement repeatedly.
There are three types of loops in Java:
1) For Loops
For loops are used in java to execute statements repeatedly for a given number of times. For loops
are used when number of times to execute the statements is known to programmer.
2) While Loops
While loop is used when certain statements need to be executed repeatedly until a condition is
fulfilled. In while loops, condition is checked first before execution of statements.
3) Do While Loops
Do While Loop is same as While loop with only difference that condition is checked after execution
of block of statements. Hence in case of do while loop, statements are executed at least once.
